# CUO-Map-Marker-Pack

Tidied up from the usual marker pack in circulation, which is just a data dump of everyone's individual user pins. The aim of this pack is to consolidate and tidy markers in to relevantly named and logical files, remove double-ups and correct mistakes or omissions. In addition most of the marker graphics have been remade to be clearer and neater.

Can be used in the ClassicUO launcher (and forks of that project such as TazUO) along with Orion.

For CUO: Copy the .MAP files and the MapIcons folder to the '\Data\Client\' directory.
For Orion: Copy the .MAP files and MapIcons folder to the 'Orion Launcher\OrionData\WorldMapExternalMarkers\' directory. Delete the existing files Orion puts in that folder - they're the data dump ones mentioned above.
